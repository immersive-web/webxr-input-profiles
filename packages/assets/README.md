# WebXR Input Profiles - Assets

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles)

## Overview
This package provides 3D assets and JSON descriptions of how to relate those assets to the `XRInputSource` objects with matching profile ids. This package can be used on its own, but may be easier to use with the javascript library in the [@webxr-input-source/motion-controllers](../motion-controllers) package also published by this repository. Assets are available under MIT license in .glTF, or .glb formats.

We also have some [simple statistics about library usage](./stats/);

## Contributing
All profiles are located under the './profiles' folder in subfolders for vendor prefixes. At build time, these profiles are combined with the matching profiles from the [registry](../packages/registry/README.md) package and a merged JSON profile is output for each match.

### Adding an asset
New assets must match a profile a profiles id in the [registry](../registry) package. To add an asset, save a JSON file that conforms with the [schema](#schema) in `./profiles/[profile id]/`. In the same `./profiles/[profile id]/` folder, place the `.glb` files for each supported handedness.  The package must [build](#development) successfully before submitting a pull request.

### Filing a bug
To file bugs on existing assets, use this [issue template](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles/issues/new?assignees=&labels=assets&template=asset-bug-report.md&title=)

### Development
In general, this package should be built and tested from the root of the repository using the following command:
> npm run test

To build just this package without running tests, invoke the following command from the root of the repository:
> npm run build -- --scope @webxr-input-profiles/assets

To visually validate the asset looks and behaves as expected, follow the [viewer](../viewer) instructions.

## Usage

### Getting started
To install this package:
```
npm install @webxr-input-profiles/assets
```

## Schema

### Profile id
Profiles are required to have a `profileId` that uniquely identifies the profile and must match an existing profile id in the [registry](../registry/README.md).

```json
{
    "profileId" : "motion-controller-id"
}
```

### Overrides
By default the asset profile is dynamically generated based on the registry profile during the asset package build step.  These values can be overriden through the `overrides` property in the asset configuraiton file.

When supplied, the `overrides` property is required to have a `layouts` child property which contains overrides for a specific `handedness` values. The `layouts` property must each have one, and only one, of the following arrangements of keys to be considered valid.
* At least one of: `none`, `left`, or `right`
* `left-right`
* `left-right` and `none`
* `left-right-none`

For example:
```json
{
    "overrides": {
        "layouts": {
            "left": {}
        }
    },
}
```
Or:
```json
{
    "overrides": {
        "layouts": {
            "none" : {},
            "left-right": {}
        }
    }
}
```

All specified handedness values must be present in the associated registry profile.  For example, if the registry has a defined `left-right` layout, the asset json can override `left` but not `none`.

### Layouts
Within each layout, there must be a `rootNodeName`, `assetPath`, and/or a `components` property. The `rootNodeName` describes the top node in the 3D asset hierarchy representing the motion controller. As Maya files cannot name nodes with "-" characters, the default value for this node name is `<profile id>_<handedness>` with all "-" in the profile id changed to "\_". The `assetPath` is the relative path to the asset for the layout, and is set to `<handedness>.glb` by default.  The `components` property is explained further in the [components](#components) section.
```json
{
    "left" : {
        "rootNodeName": "generic_trigger_left",
        "assetPath": "left.glb",
        "components": {}
    }
}
```

### Components
The `components` property may only contain keys for components defined in the associated registry profile.  When present, a component id key must point to an object which contains `rootNodeName`, `touchPointNodeName`, and/or `visualResponses`. The `rootNodeName` of a component describes the top node of a component within the 3D asset hierarchy. As Maya files cannot name nodes with "-" characters, the default value for this node name is `<component id>` with all "-" in the id changed to "\_". The `touchPointNodeName` is the name of the node in the asset which will be updated to match the user's finger location on a touchpad. This node is named `<rootNodeName>_axes_touched_value` by default and is where developers may attach geometry to indicate a touch point. The `visualResponses` property contains the collection of [visual changes](#visual-responses) the component can apply in response to state changes in the backing `XRInputSource`.

For example
```json
{
    "components": {
        "xr-standard-touchpad": {
            "rootNodeName" : "xr_standard_trigger",
            "touchPointNodeName": "xr_standard_touchpad_axes_touched_value",
            "visualResponses": {}
        }
    }
}
```

### Visual responses
The visual representation of a motion controller in a VR must respond to reflect its physical state in the real-world.  For example, when a physical thumbstick is moved to the left, the virtual thumbstick should also move to the left.  The `visualResponses` object contains descriptions of all visual changes that will be applied when the associated controller component is interacted with.

The `visualResponses` object contains children that each uniquely describe a single visual response to be applied to the asset and the key name should reflect that purpose.  The children of `visualResponses` may be null, in which case the key name must match a default visual reponse to be removed from the generate profile.  When non-null, the object contain `componentProperty`, `states`, and `valueNodeProperty` children.

The `componentProperty` property must be set to one of four values: `button`, `xAxis`, `yAxis`, or `state`.  This indicates which component property will be used to drive the visualization.  The `states` array indicates the component states for which the visualization will apply and must contain at least one of the following values: `default`, `touched`, `pressed`.  The `valueNodeProperty` indicates which property of the asset's node will be modified in response the XRInputSource changes.  It must either be set to `transform` or `visibility`.  When set to `visibility`, `componentProperty` must be set to `state`.

```json
{
    "visualResponses" : {
        "pressed": {
            "componentProperty": "button",
            "states": ["touched", "pressed"],
            "valueNodeProperty": "transform"
        }
    }
}
```

In order for `visualResponses` to function, the associated 3D asset must contain a node named `<rootNodeName>_<visual response name>_value` whose `valueNodeProperty` will be modified in response to changes in the XRInputSource.  When the `valueNodeProperty` is a `transform`, the transform value will be interpolated between the transforms of the two nodes named `<rootNodeName>_<visual response name>_min` and `<rootNodeName>_<visual response name>_max`.

Components have the following visual responses by default:

| Type       | Responses       | Component Property | Min                   | Max                 |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Trigger    | `pressed`       | button value       | Unpressed             | Pressed             |
| Squeeze    | `pressed`       | button value       | Unpressed             | Pressed             |
| Thumbstick | `pressed`       | button value       | Unpressed             | Pressed             |
|            | `xaxis_pressed` | x axis value       | Tipped left           | Tipped right        |
|            | `yaxis_pressed` | y axis value       | Tipped up             | Tipped down         |
| Touchpad   | `pressed`       | button value       | Unpressed             | Pressed             |
|            | `xaxis_pressed` | x axis value       | Tipped left           | Tipped right        |
|            | `yaxis_pressed` | y axis value       | Tipped up             | Tipped down         |
|            | `xaxis_touched` | x axis value       | Touch point left      | Touch point right   |
|            | `yaxis_touched` | y axis value       | Touch point up        | Touch point down    |
|            | `axes_touched`  | button touched     | Touch point invisible | Touch point visible |
| Button     | `pressed`       | button value       | Unpressed             | Pressed             |
